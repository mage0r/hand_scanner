Attiny 84 LCD Display for the HD44780
=============

This project uses an Attiny 84 to drive LCD Displays that use the HD44780 driver.  It's simple, small and compatible with a range of sizes.  The board can easily be trimmed down to the standard 16x2 size or left at it's original size for 20x4.

This version includes a large prototyping area and a mounting for a "mesthingy" from http://www.m9design.co/

There are three sections, the circuit design for kicad, some i2c arduino sketches and a few photos of the finished product.

This version is compatible with Marc Merlin's NewLiquidCrystal library (https://github.com/marcmerlin)
